# Requirement Planning & Analysis

In the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), Requirement Planning & Analysis is the critical first phase. It is where abstract ideas are transformed into concrete, actionable technical specifications. Skipping or rushing this phase is the leading cause of scope creep, budget overruns, and technical debt later in the project.

## Key Objectives

1. **Feasibility Study:** Determining if the project is technically, financially, and operationally viable.
2. **Requirement Gathering:** Collecting detailed functional requirements (what the system does) and non-functional requirements (how the system performs, e.g., latency, throughput) from stakeholders.
3. **Risk Analysis:** Identifying potential technical bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or resource constraints early on.

## Core Activities

* **Stakeholder Interviews:** Engaging with users, business owners, and domain experts to understand the "pain points" the software must solve.
* **SRS Creation:** Drafting the **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document. This acts as the "source of truth" for developers and QA engineers throughout the lifecycle.
* **Tech Stack Selection:** Deciding on languages (e.g., TypeScript vs. Rust), databases (PostgreSQL vs. MongoDB), and infrastructure (AWS vs. Azure) based on the specific constraints identified.
* **High-Level Design (HLD):** Sketching out the initial system boundaries, data flow, and component interactions.

## Why It Matters

> "The cost to fix a bug found during the requirements phase is orders of magnitude lower than fixing it during production."

A solid planning phase ensures that the development team builds the *right* product, rather than just building the product *right*. It aligns business goals with engineering reality.
